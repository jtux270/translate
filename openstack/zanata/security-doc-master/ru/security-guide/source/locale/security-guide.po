"capable of effectively preventing or detecting and correcting weaknesses and "
"deficiencies. A control must pass this test to be evaluated in the second "
"phase. This is because with a control that is designed ineffectually, there "
"is no point considering whether it is operating effectively. The second part "
"is operational effectiveness. Operational effectiveness testing will "
"determine how the control was applied, the consistency with which the "
"control was applied and by whom or by what means the control was applied. A "

"Private clouds are typically deployed by enterprises or institutions inside "

"policies on what data is allowed to exit their network and may even have "
"different clouds for specific purposes. Users of a private cloud are "
"typically employees of the organization that owns the cloud and are able to "
"be held accountable for their actions. Employees often attend training "
"sessions before accessing the cloud and will likely take part in regularly "
"scheduled security awareness training. Public clouds by contrast cannot make "
"any assertions about their users, cloud use-cases or user motivations. This "
"immediately pushes the guest security domain into a completely *untrusted* "
"state for public cloud providers."

"A notable difference in the attack surface of public clouds is that they "

"Careful consideration should be given to potential outbound abuse from a "

"Clouds with compute services make for ideal DDoS and brute force engines. "
"The issue is more pressing for public clouds as their users are largely "
"unaccountable, and can quickly spin up numerous disposable instances for "
"outbound attacks. Major damage can be inflicted upon a company's reputation "
"if it becomes known for hosting malicious software or launching attacks on "

"To address the often mentioned concern of tenant data privacy and limiting "
"cloud provider liability, there is greater interest within the OpenStack "
"community to make data encryption more ubiquitous. It is relatively easy for "
"an end-user to encrypt their data prior to saving it to the cloud, and this "
"is a viable path for tenant objects such as media files, database archives "
"among others. In some instances, client-side encryption is utilized to "
"encrypt data held by the virtualization technologies which requires client "
"interaction, such as presenting keys, to decrypt data for future use. To "
"seamlessly secure the data and have it accessible without burdening the "
"client with having to manage their keys and interactively provide them calls "
"for a key management service within OpenStack. Providing encryption and key "
"management services as part of OpenStack eases data-at-rest security "
"adoption and addresses customer concerns about privacy or misuse of data, "
"while also limiting cloud provider liability. This can help reduce a "
