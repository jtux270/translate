"Why are we deprecating Certificate Issuance? There are a few reasons that "

"of interest in the community to fully develop the Certificate Authority "
"integration with Barbican.  We have a few outstanding blueprints that are "
"needed to make Certificate Issuance fully functional, but so far no one has "
"committed to getting the work done.  Additionally, we've had very little buy-"
"in from public Certificate Authorities.  Both Symantec and Digicert were "
"interested in integration in the past, but that interest didn't materialize "
"into robust CA plugins like we hoped it would. Secondly, there have been new "
"developments in the space of Certificate Authorities since we started "
"Barbican.  The most significant of these was the launch of the Let's Encrypt "
"public CA along with the definition of the ACME protocol for certificate "
"issuance.  We believe that future certificate authority services would do "
"good to implement the ACME standard, which is quite different than the API "
"the Barbican team had developed. Lastly, deprecating Certificate Issuance "
"within Barbican will simplify both the architecture and deployment of "
"Barbican.  This will allow us to focus on the features that Barbican does "
"well -- the secure storage of secret material."

"Will Barbican still be able to store Certificates? Yes, absolutely!  The "

"store any certificates in Barbican, including those issued by public CAs or "
