"\"Choooooo! Choooooo!\" The Train is now departing the station. The "
"OpenStack Bare Metal as a service team is proud to announce the release of "
"Ironic 13.0.0. This release brings the long desired feature of software RAID "
"configuration, Redfish virtual media boot support, sensor data improvements, "
"and numerous bug fixes. We hope you enjoy your ride on the OpenStack Ironic "
"Train."

"\"Dynamic drivers\" is a revamp of how drivers are composed. Rather than a "
"huge matrix of hardware drivers supporting different things, now users "
"select a \"hardware type\" for a machine, and can independently change the "
"deploy method, console manager, RAID management, power control interface, "
"etc. This is experimental, as not all \"classic\" drivers have a dynamic "
"equivalent yet, but we encourage users to try this feature out and submit "
"feedback."
