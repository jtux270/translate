"With over 6,000 developers from over 300 different organizations worldwide, "
"OpenStack is one of the largest collaborative software-development projects. "

"We've designed a training program to share knowledge about the different "
"ways of contributing to OpenStack like providing new features, writing "
"documentation, participating in working groups, and so forth. The "
"educational program is built on the principle of open collaboration and will "
"teach the students how to find information and navigate the intricacies of "
"the project's technical tools and social interactions in order to get their "
"contributions accepted. The live one and a half day class is focusing on "
"hands-on practice like the students can use a prepared development "
"environment to learn how to test, prepare and upload new code snippets or "
"documentation for review. The attendees are also given the opportunity to "
"join a mentoring program to get further help and guidance on their journey "

"the results of their work."

"Once the students are separated into their new roles, and have an "

"and access to a whiteboard or flipchart. For companies, ensure the CEO sets "
"a direction, and the team is on board. Their responsibility is to deliver "
"value to their stakeholders. For upstream, have them think about the "
"community standards they want to set: they are responsible for the quality "
"of the finished product. For free agent contributors, use this time to get "
"them to understand their role in the simulation: explain their part as "
"agents of chaos. They can get straight to work as soon as they understand "
"their role, no need to wait for the timer to go off. The free agents should "
"not be forced to coordinate among themselves: there are better results if "
"they find out how hard it is to accomplish anything without coordinating "
"with others. In theory, the free agents can decide to demolish things, too: "
"try suggesting this option to one of them, see what happens."
