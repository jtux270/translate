"The glance_store configuration options have been improved with detailed help "

"``max`` boundaries. It is to be noted that the configuration options that "
"take integer values now have a strict range defined with \"min\" and/or "
"\"max\" boundaries where appropriate. This renders the configuration options "
"incapable of taking certain values that may have been accepted before but "
"were actually invalid. For example, configuration options specifying counts, "
"where a negative value was undefined, would have still accepted the supplied "
"negative value. Such options will no longer accept negative values. However, "
"options where a negative value was previously defined (for example, -1 to "
"mean unlimited) will remain unaffected by this change. Values that do not "
"comply with the appropriate restrictions will prevent the service from "
"starting. The logs will contain a message indicating the problematic "
"configuration option and the reason why the supplied value has been rejected."
