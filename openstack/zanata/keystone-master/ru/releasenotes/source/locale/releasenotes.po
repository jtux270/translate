"This release adds support for Application Credentials, a new way to allow "

"than storing a username and password in an application's config file, which "
"can pose security risks, you can now create an application credential to "
"allow an application to authenticate and acquire a preset scope and role "
"assignments. This is especially useful for LDAP and federated users, who can "
"now delegate their cloud management tasks to a keystone-specific resource, "
"rather than share their externally managed credentials with keystone and "
"risk a compromise of those external systems. Users can delegate a subset of "
"their role assignments to an application credential, allowing them to "
"strategically limit their application's access to the minimum needed. Unlike "
"passwords, a user can have more than one active application credential, "

"This release leverages oslo.policy's policy-in-code feature to modify the "

"policies. These changes make the policies more precise than they were "
"before, using the reader, member, and admin roles where previously only the "
"admin role and a catch-all rule was available. The changes also take "
"advantage of system, domain, and project scope, allowing you to create role "
"assignments for your users that are appropriate to the actions they need to "
"perform. Eventually this will allow you to set ``[oslo_policy]/enforce_scope="
"true`` in your keystone configuration, which simplifies access control "
"management by ensuring that oslo.policy checks both the role and the scope "
"on API requests. However, please be aware that not all policies have been "
"converted in this release and some changes are still under development. "
"During the transition phase, if you have not overridden a policy, the old "
"default and the new default will be OR'd together. This means that, for "
"example, where we have changed the policy rule from ``'rule:"
"admin_required'`` to ``'role:reader and system_scope:all'``, both policy "
"rules will be in effect. Please check your current policies and role "
"assignments before upgrading to ensure the policies will not be too "
"permissive for your deployment. To hide the deprecation warnings and opt "
"into the less permissive rules, you can override the policy configuration to "
"use the newer policy rule."
