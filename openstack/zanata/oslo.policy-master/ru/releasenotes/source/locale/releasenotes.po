"A new configuration option ``enforce_new_defaults`` has been added to the "
"``[oslo_policy]`` group to control whether or not to use the old deprecated "
"defaults. If ``True``, the old deprecated defaults are not going to be "
"evaluated which means if any existing token is allowed for old defaults but "
"disallowed for new defaults it will be disallowed. It is encouraged to "
"enable this flag along with the ``enforce_scope`` flag so that you can get "
"the benefits of new defaults and ``scope_type`` together. This way operators "

"logged for operators. Note that operators should only enable this option "
"once they've audited their users to ensure system users have roles on the "
"system. This could potentially prevent some users from being able to make "
