"This patch set implements the following functionality for Cassandra "
"datastore. create/delete/get user list users change password grant/revoke/"
"list access update attributes create/delete database list databases Notes on "
"Cassandra users In Cassandra only SUPERUSERS can create other users and "
"grant permissions to database resources. Trove uses the 'os_admin' superuser "
"to perform its administrative tasks. It proactively removes the built-in "
"'cassandra' superuser on prepare. The users it creates are all 'normal' "
"(NOSUPERUSER) accounts. The permissions it can grant are also limited to non-"
"superuser operations. This is to prevent anybody from creating a new "
"superuser via the Trove API. Updatable attributes include username and "
"password. The configuration template had to be updated to enable "
"authentication and authorization support (original configuration allowed "
"anonymous connections). Default implementations used are authenticator org."
"apache.cassandra.auth.PasswordAuthenticator authorizer org.apache.cassandra."
"auth.CassandraAuthorizer The superuser password is set to a random Trove "
"password which is then stored in a Trove-read-only file in '~/.cassandra/"
"cqlshrc' which is also the default location for client settings. Notes on "
"Cassandra keyspaces Cassandra stores replicas on multiple nodes to ensure "
"reliability and fault tolerance. All replicas are equally important; there "
"is no primary or master. A replication strategy determines the nodes where "
"replicas are placed. The total number of replicas across the cluster is "
"referred to as the replication factor. The above 'create database' "
"implementation uses 'SimpleStrategy' with just a single replica on the guest "
"machine. This is a very simplistic configuration only good for the most "
"basic applications and demonstration purposes. SimpleStrategy is for a "
"single data center only. The following system keyspaces have been included "
"in the default 'ignore_dbs' configuration list and therefore excluded from "
"all database operations 'system', 'system_auth', 'system_traces' Notes on "
"user rename Cassandra does not have a native way for renaming users. The "
"reason why Cassandra itself does not implement rename is apparently just "
"lack of demand for that feature. We implement it by creating a new user, "
"transferring permissions and dropping the old one (which also removes its "
"existing permissions). I asked about the sanity of this rename approach on "
"the Cassandra mailing list and IRC channel and there should not be anything "
"inherently wrong with the proposed procedure. This method, however, requires "
"the user to always provide a password. Additional notes Trove uses the "
"official open-source Python driver for Cassandra to connect to the database "
"and execute queries. The connection is implemented in CassandraConnection. "
"It is now also used to obtain the current database status as opposed to the "
"original method of parsing output of the client tool. The 'common/"
"operating_system' module was extended with two new functions for reading/"
"writing ini-style and YAML configuration files to/from Python dicts. Unit "
"tests were added to 'guestagent/test_operating_system'. The existing Manager "
"unit tests were extended to include the added functionality. Also includes "
"some minor improvements to comments and log messages. Used the existing "
"operating_system interface to update file ownership. The system module was "
"removed and its contents moved to the Application class. This is to reduce "
"the number of files and help facilitate overriding."
