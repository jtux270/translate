"During the Wallaby release, API RBAC policies have new defaults, however, "
"all old behavior is preserved as is, and the new defaults are not enabled. "
"We encourage operators to generate the default policies via ``oslopolicy-"
"sample-generator --namespace manila`` and compare them with any overrides "
"you may currently have. These new default rules may enable you to remove "
"matching overrides and reduce your policy maintenance burden. Refer to `the "
"document on Service API protection <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/"
"latest/admin/service-api-protection.html>`_ from the OpenStack Identity "
"Service to understand roles, scopes, user personas and the motivation behind "
"these changes. To be able to use systems scoped personas, you will need to "
"enable the ``enforce_scope`` configuration option in the ``[oslo_policy]`` "
"section of manila.conf. To enforce the new defaults, the configuration "
"option ``enforce_new_defaults`` must be enabled from the ``[oslo_policy]`` "
"section of manila.conf. We do not advise enabling the new defaults in "
"production deployments yet. The manila developer community is actively "
"adding test coverage and we aim to backport fixes to the Wallaby release and "
"update code when we find any deficiencies. Refer to the future service "
"release notes and the administrator documentation to keep abreast of the "
"changes and the progress with these new defaults."

"`Bug #1900755 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1900755>`_: Added a "
"driver-agnostic exception to handle insufficient privileges on a security "
"service when trying to create a share. Added a user message to provide "
"useful information to end users. Note that vendors will need to implement "
"the exception provided in this patch in their drivers to take advantage of "
"the more convenient user message."
