.SH "NAME"
ipa\-adtrust\-install \- Prepare an IPA server to be able to establish trust relationships with AD domains
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-adtrust\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adds all necessary objects and configuration to allow an IPA server to create a
trust to an Active Directory domain. This requires that the IPA server is
already installed and configured.

ipa\-adtrust\-install can be run multiple times to reinstall deleted objects or
broken configuration files. E.g. a fresh samba configuration (smb.conf file and
registry based configuration can be created. Other items like e.g. the
configuration of the local range cannot be changed by running
ipa\-adtrust\-install a second time because with changes here other objects
might be affected as well.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Enable debug logging when more verbose output is needed
.TP
\fB\-\-ip\-address\fR=\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR
The IP address of the IPA server. If not provided then this is determined based on the hostname of the server.
.TP
\fB\-\-netbios\-name\fR=\fINETBIOS_NAME\fR
The NetBIOS name for the IPA domain. If not provided then this is determined
based on the leading component of the DNS domain name. Running
ipa\-adtrust\-install for a second time with a different NetBIOS name will
change the name. Please note that changing the NetBIOS name might break
existing trust relationships to other domains.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-msdcs\fR
Do not create DNS service records for Windows in managed DNS server. Since those
DNS service records are the only way to discover domain controllers of other
domains they must be added manually to a different DNS server to allow trust
realationships work properly. All needed service records are listed when
ipa\-adtrust\-install finishes and either \-\-no\-msdcs was given or no IPA DNS
service is configured. Typically service records for the following service names
are needed for the IPA domain which should point to all IPA servers:
.IP
\(bu _ldap._tcp
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._tcp
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._udp
.IP
\(bu _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._tcp.dc._msdcs
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._udp.dc._msdcs
.IP
\(bu _ldap._tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs
.IP
\(bu _kerberos._udp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.dc._msdcs
.TP
\fB\-\-add\-sids\fR
Add SIDs to existing users and groups as a final step of the
ipa\-adtrust\-install run. If there a many existing users and groups and a
couple of replicas in the environment this operation might lead to a high
replication traffic and a performance degradation of all IPA servers in the
environment. To avoid this the SID generation can be run after
ipa\-adtrust\-install is run and scheduled independently. To start this task
you have to load an edited version of ipa-sidgen-task-run.ldif with the
ldapmodify command info the directory server.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unattended\fR
An unattended installation that will never prompt for user input
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-rid-base\fR=\fIRID_BASE\fR
First RID value of the local domain. The first Posix ID of the local domain will
be assigned to this RID, the second to RID+1 etc. See the online help of the
idrange CLI for details.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-secondary-rid-base\fR=\fISECONDARY_RID_BASE\fR
Start value of the secondary RID range, which is only used in the case a user
and a group share numerically the same Posix ID. See the online help of the
idrange CLI for details.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-admin\-name\fR=\fIADMIN_NAME\fR
The name of the user with administrative privileges for this IPA server. Defaults to 'admin'.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-admin\-password\fR=\fIpassword\fR
The password of the user with administrative privileges for this IPA server. Will be asked interactively if \fB\-U\fR is not specified.
.TP
The credentials of the admin user will be used to obtain Kerberos ticket before configuring cross-realm trusts support and afterwards, to ensure that the ticket contains MS-PAC information required to actually add a trust with Active Directory domain via 'ipa trust-add --type=ad' command.
.TP
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
0 if the installation was successful

1 if an error occurred
