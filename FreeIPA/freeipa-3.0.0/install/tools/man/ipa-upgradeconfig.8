.SH "NAME"
ipa\-upgradeconfig \- Upgrade the IPA Apache configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-upgradeconfig
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A tool to update the IPA Apache configuration during an upgrade.

It examines the VERSION value in the head of \fI/etc/httpd/conf.d/ipa.conf\fR and \fI/etc/httpd/conf.d/ipa\-rewrite.conf\fR and compares this with the templates. If an update is needed then new files are written.

It also will convert a CA configured to be accessible via ports 9443, 9444, 9445 and 9446 to be proxied by the IPA web server on ports 80 and 443.

This is not intended to be run by an end\-user. It is executed when the IPA rpms are upgraded. This must be run as the root user.
