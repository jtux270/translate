# Programmable completion for the IPA ipa command under bash. Source
# this file (or on some systems add it to ~/.bash_completion and start a new
# shell) and bash's completion mechanism will know all about ipa's options!

# Known to work with bash 2.05a with programmable completion and extended
# pattern matching enabled (use 'shopt -s extglob progcomp' to enable
# these if they are not already enabled).

# based on the bzr bash completion script by Martin Pool
