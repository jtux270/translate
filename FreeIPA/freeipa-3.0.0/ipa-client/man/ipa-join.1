.SH "NAME"
ipa\-join \- Join a machine to an IPA realm and get a keytab for the host service principal
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-join [\fB\-d\fR|\fB\-\-debug\fR] [\fB\-q\fR|\fB\-\-quiet\fR] [\fB\-u\fR|\fB\-\-unenroll\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-hostname\fR hostname] [\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-\-server\fR hostame] [\fB\-k\fR|\fB\-\-keytab\fR filename] [\fB\-w\fR|\fB\-\-bindpw\fR password] [\fB-b\fR|\-\-\fBbasedn basedn\fR] [\fB\-?\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Joins a host to an IPA realm and retrieves a kerberos \fIkeytab\fR for the host service principal, or unenrolls an enrolled host from an IPA server.

Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos principal.

The ipa\-join command will create and retrieve a service principal for host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and place it by default into /etc/krb5.keytab. The location can be overridden with the \-k option.

The IPA server to contact is set in /etc/ipa/default.conf by default and can be overridden using the \-s,\-\-server option.

In order to join the machine needs to be authenticated. This can happen in one of two ways:

* Authenticate using the current kerberos principal

* Provide a password to authenticate with

If a client host has already been joined to the IPA realm the ipa\-join command will fail. The host will need to be removed from the server using `ipa host\-del FQDN` in order to join the client to the realm.

This command is normally executed by the ipa\-client\-install command as part of the enrollment process.

The reverse is unenrollment. Unenrolling a host removes the Kerberos key on the IPA server. This prepares the host to be re\-enrolled. This uses the host principal stored in /etc/krb5.conf to authenticate to the IPA server to perform the unenrollment.

Please note, that while the ipa\-join option removes the client from the domain, it does not actually uninstall the client or properly remove all of the IPA\-related configuration. The only way to uninstall a client completely is to use ipa\-client\-install \-\-uninstall
(see
.BR ipa\-client\-install (1)).

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-h,\-\-hostname hostname\fR
The hostname of this server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is used.
.TP
\fB\-s,\-\-server server\fR
The hostname of the IPA server (FQDN). Note that by default there is no /etc/ipa/default.conf, in most cases it needs to be supplied.
.TP
\fB\-k,\-\-keytab keytab\-file\fR
The keytab file where to append the new key (will be created if it does not exist). Default: /etc/krb5.keytab
.TP
\fB\-w,\-\-bindpw password\fR
The password to use if not using Kerberos to authenticate. Use a password of this particular host (one time password created on IPA server)
.TP
\fB\-b,\-\-basedn basedn\fR
The basedn of the IPA server (of the form dc=example,dc=com). This is only needed when not using Kerberos to authenticate and anonymous binds are disallowed in the IPA LDAP server.
.TP
\fB\-f,\-\-force\fR
Force enrolling the host even if host entry exists.
.TP
\fB\-u,\-\-unenroll\fR
Unenroll this host from the IPA server. No keytab entry is removed in the process
(see
.BR ipa-rmkeytab (1)).
.TP
\fB\-q,\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.
.TP
\fB\-d,\-\-debug\fR
Print the raw XML-RPC output in GSSAPI mode.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab with kerberos credentials.

  # kinit admin
  # ipa\-join

Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab using a one\-time password.

  # ipa\-join \-w secret123

Join IPA domain and save the keytab in another location.

  # ipa\-join \-k /tmp/host.keytab
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The exit status is 0 on success, nonzero on error.
