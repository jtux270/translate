Code to be installed on any client that wants to be in an IPA domain.

Mostly consists of a tool for Linux systems that will help configure the
client so it will work properly in a kerberized environment.

It also includes several ways to configure Firefox to do single sign-on.

The two methods on the client side are:

1. globalsetup.sh. This modifies the global Firefox installation so that
   any profiles created will be pre-configured.

2. usersetup.sh. This will update a user's existing profile.

The downside of #1 is that an rpm -V will return a failure. It will also
need to be run with every update of Firefox.

One a profile contains the proper preferences it will be unaffected by
upgrades to Firefox. 

The downside of #2 is that every user would need to run this each time they
create a new profile.

There is a third, server-side method. See ipa-server/README for details.
