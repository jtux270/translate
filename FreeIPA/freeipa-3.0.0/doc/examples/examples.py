Example plugins

# Hey guys, so you're interested in writing plugins for IPA? Great!
# We compiled this small file with examples on how to extend IPA to suit
# your needs. We'll be going from very simple to pretty complex plugins
# hopefully covering most of what our framework has to offer.

# First, let's import some stuff.

# api is an object containing references to all plugins and useful classes.
# errors is a module containing all IPA specific exceptions.
from ipalib import api, errors
# Command is the base class for command plugin.
from ipalib import Command
# Str is a subclass of Param, it is used to define string parameters for
# command. We'll go through all other subclasses of Param supported by IPA
# later in this file
from ipalib import Str
# output is a module containing the most common output patterns.
# Command plugin do output validation based on these patterns.
# You can define your own as we're going to show you later.
from ipalib import output


# We're going to create an example command plugin, that takes a name as its
# only argument. Commands in IPA support input validation by defining
# functions we're going to call 'validators'. This is an example of such
# function:
def validate_name(ugettext, name):
    """
    Validate names for the exhelloworld command. Names starting with 'Y'
    (picked at random) are considered invalid.
    """
    if name.startswith('Y'):
        raise errors.ValidationError(
            name='name',
            error='Names starting with \'Y\' are invalid!'
        )
    # If the validator doesn't return anything (i.e. it returns None),
    # the parameter passes validation.


class exhelloworld(Command):
    """
    Example command: Hello world!
    """
    # takes_args is an attribute of Command. It's a tuple containing
    # instances of Param (or its subclasses such as Str) that define
    # what position arguments are accepted by the command.
    takes_args = (
        # The first argument of Param constructor is the name that will be
        # used to identify this parameter. It can be followed by validator
        # functions. The constructor can also take a bunch of keyword
        # arguments. Here we use default, to set the parameters default value
        # and autofill, that fills the default value if the parameter isn't
        # present.
        # Note the ? at the end of the parameter name. It makes the parameter
        # optional.
        Str('name?', validate_name,
            default=u'anonymous coward',
            autofill=True,
        ),
    )

    # has_output is an attribute of Command, it is a tuple containing
    # output.Output instances that define its output pattern.
    # Commands in IPA return dicts with keys corresponding to items
    # in the has_output tuple.
    has_output = (
        # output.summary is one of the basic patterns.
        # It's a string that should be filled with a user-friendly
        # decription of the action performed by the command.
        output.summary,
    )

    # Every command needs to override the execute method.
    # This is where the command functionality should go.
    # It is always executed on the server-side, so don't rely
    # on client-side stuff in here!
    def execute(self, name):
        return dict(summary='Hello world, %s!' % name)

# register the command, uncomment this line if you want to try it out
#api.register(exhelloworld)

# Anyway, that was a pretty bad example of a command or, to be more precise,
# a bad example of resource use. When a client executes a command locally, its
# name and parameters are transfered to the server over XML-RPC. The command
# execute method is then executed on the server and results are transfered
# back to the client. The command does nothing, but create a string - a task
# that could be easily done locally. This can be done by overriding the Command
# forward method. It has the same signature as execute and is normally
# responsible for transferring stuff to the server.
# Most commands will, however, need to perfom tasks on the server. I didn't
# want to start with forward and confuse the hell out of you. :)


# Okey, time to look at something a little more advance. A command that
# actually communicates with the LDAP backend.

# Let's import a new parameter type: Flag.
# Parameters of type Flag do not have values per say. They are either enabled
# or disabled (True or False), so there's no need to make then optional, ever.

# sake of consistency. We won't cover them here, because you probably won't
# need to use them. So why did we botter? Well, you're going to see in
# a while. If interested anyway, check them out in ipalib/crud.py.


# At this point, if you've already seen some of the real plugins, you might
# be going like "WTH is this !@#^&? The user_show plugin is only like 4 lines
# of code and does much more than the exshowuser crap. Well yes, that's because
# it is based on one of the awesome plugin base classes we created to save
# authors from doing all the dirty work. Let's take a look at them.

# COMING SOON: baseldap.py classes, extending existing plugins, etc.
