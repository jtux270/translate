Extending FreeIPA
-----------------

"Extending FreeIPA" is a developer guide to understand how FreeIPA core 
framework is built and how to extend it.

The Guide is written using Emacs Org Mode, see http://orgmode.org/org.html
for extensive manual of supported markup features.

You don't need to use Emacs to edit it, the markup is a plain text.

Building the guide
------------------

There is Makefile which can be used to convert the Guide from
Emacs Org Mode format to different targets.

Prerequisites:
==============
On Fedora system following packages are required to generate The Guide:

docbook-style-xsl
fop
emacs
xmlto

HTML, Docbook, and plain text
---
As Org Mode is part of Emacs since version 22, building HTML, TXT, and 
Docbook targets requires Emacs v22 and above (tested with v23.3 in Fedora).

PDF
---
Building PDF is done first generating Docbook source, converting it to FO format,
and then running 'fop' processor.
