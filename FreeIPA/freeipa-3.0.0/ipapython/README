This is a set of libraries common to IPA clients and servers though mostly
geared currently towards command-line tools.

A brief overview:

config.py - identify the IPA server domain and realm. It uses dnsclient to
            try to detect this information first and will fall back to
            /etc/ipa/default.conf if that fails.
dnsclient.py - find IPA information via DNS

ipautil.py - helper functions

entity.py - entity is the main data type. User and Group extend this class
            (but don't add anything currently).

ipavalidate.py - basic data validation routines
