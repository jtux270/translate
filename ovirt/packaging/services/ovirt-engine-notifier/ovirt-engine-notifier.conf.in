NOTIFIER_STOP_TIME=30

# Notification Service Configuration: #
#-------------------------------------#
# Interval (in seconds) between iterations of dispatching messages to subscribers. Default is 120 seconds.
INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS=120

#
# Idle task interval
# Interval in seconds to perform low priority tasks.

# Amount of days to keep dispatched events on history table. If 0, events remain on history table for ever.
DAYS_TO_KEEP_HISTORY=0

# Send a notification email after first failure to fetch notifications,
# and then once every failedQueriesNotificationThreshold times.
# 0 or 1 means notify on each failure.

# the notification service cannot connect to the DB. can be empty.
# Deprecated, use FILTER with DATABASE_UNREACHABLE instead.
FAILED_QUERIES_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=

# This parameter specifies how many days of old events are processed and sent
# when the notifier starts. If set to 2, for example, the notifier will
# process and send the events of the last two days, older events will just
# be marked as processed and won't be sent. The default is 0, so no old
# messages will be sent at all during startup.
DAYS_TO_SEND_ON_STARTUP=0

# Event Filter #
#--------------#

# Filter logic.
#
# First match algorithm for include/exclude messages.
# Entry is message|*(subscriber|*)
# * = all messages/all subscribers.
# * as a subscriber should be used only for exclude.
#
# Message constants can be found at:
# @ENGINE_DOC@/AuditLogMessages.properties
#
# examples:
# FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:mail@example.com) ${FILTER}"
# FILTER="exclude:VDC_START include:*(smtp:mail1@gmail.com) ${FILTER}"
#
# The final filter list contains FILTER  as well as 'event_subscriber' table records.
# database record are considered first.

# Indicates type of encryption (none, ssl or tls) should be used to communicate with mail server.

# If set to true, sends a message in HTML format.

# Specifies 'from' address on sent mail in RFC822 format, if supported by mail server.

# Specifies 'reply-to' address on sent mail in RFC822 format.

# Note: changing the default will prevent generated traps from complying with OVIRT-MIB.txt.

#
# SNMP profile support
#
# Multiple SNMP profiles are supported.
# Specify profile settings by using _profile suffix,

# SNMP_MANAGERS_profile1=host3
# FILTER="include:VDC_START(snmp:profile1) ${FILTER}"

# Specifies the protocol used by Jboss Configuration Connector when SSL is enabled.
SSL_PROTOCOL=TLS

# If running Jboss in secure mode, and wishes to ignore SSL errors, should set to true.
SSL_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS=false

# If running Jboss in secure mode, and wishes to ignore hostname verification, should set to true. Default is false.
# If setting this property to 'true', SSL_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS considered to be set to 'true' as well: disabling host name
# verification means that it will not be verified against the certification, therefore certification errors are ignored.
SSL_IGNORE_HOST_VERIFICATION=false

# Specifies whether to repeat auditing of failure messages of non-responding engine server. false means
# repeated failure messages will NOT be sent to the subscribers.
